All the neighbours could hear Anisa’s husband abusing her but the police officers did not bother to get out of the patrol car. “They just rolled down their car windows and left,” Anisa’s neighbour angrily wrote on Facebook that evening. “No stress, guys. Television only cares about the bodies. So when he kills her, I’ll tell a television channel to call you.” Less than three weeks later, Anisa was dead, murdered by her husband. Neither can be named in full as the case has yet to reach trial. In a statement to police, the perpetrator described how he was overcome with jealousy after Anisa allegedly cheated on him. “I took the knife with my right hand and entered her room. She was sleeping, and I rushed to her and lay on her, stabbing her with the knife in her neck,” he said. He later retracted his claim that Anisa was asleep when he killed her. “He finally killed her. That’s all I have to say,” their neighbour wrote on Facebook after the murder. At the time, Anisa’s murder was the sixth femicide in Greece this year. Since then, at least another six women across the country have been murdered by their partners or ex-partners.    They try to make excuses and say it was a crime of passion or something else, so they get a lesser sentence    Feminist groups estimate that at least one woman in Greece dies at the hands of a man each month, often their partner or ex-partner. Of the 11 victims of femicide so far this year, two had previously tried to report their attacker for domestic violence before they were murdered, but none of the men had been charged or convicted. A third woman in the coastal city of Volos was in the process of trying to obtain a restraining order when she was stabbed to death by her ex-husband. The spate of femicides throughout this year have shone a spotlight on police failings when it comes to combatting violence against women, including accusations from victims’ families that statements from officials acted as a blueprint for would-be attackers on how to kill with impunity. Lawyers and campaigners also point to clauses in the Greek penal code that they say enable a culture of impunity around violence against women. These allow reduced sentences for those accused of homicide if they were “provoked” or the crime was committed in a rage – often referred to as a “crime of passion” – or if the accused displayed good behaviour before the incident and showed guilt afterwards. They say adding femicide as a motive to the penal code would act as a vital counterweight, denying perpetrators the opportunity to present themselves in court as innocent men suddenly overcome by emotion that justified murder.   Domestic violence figures   Ioanna Panagopoulou, a lawyer who represents the families of several victims of femicide, says: “No one in my entire career has ever taken full responsibility, confessing they planned the murder exactly as it happened. They try to make excuses and say it was a crime of passion or something else so they get a lesser sentence.” Panagopoulou is a forceful presence. She flips through a legal dictionary, a wall covered in religious icons behind her, as she describes how broadly courts can interpret clauses in the penal code that allow for reduced sentences for femicide. “If the person cooperates with the police afterwards, that’s considered good behaviour,” she says, adding that she receives calls about domestic violence every single day. “Most days I receive two or three,” she says, spreading her hands wide to show the scope of the problem. Families of victims say that lax punishment for femicide is just one of several ways in which the Greek state fails women, including ignoring them when they report domestic violence. Campaigners say this can prove deadly, as police inaction emboldens perpetrators and can result in femicide. Data from the Hellenic police, the national force, shows a steady rise in domestic violence reports over the past decade. “There is a culture of violence towards women,” says Anna Razou, a forensic doctor at an Athens hospital who assesses survivors of domestic violence. Razou says she has also seen a rise in complaints, including an unusual spike this year during Greece’s annual holiday month of August, which is normally a quiet period. She views this as a sign that Greek women feel increasingly compelled to report violence in the wake of Greece’s #MeToo movement, which began earlier this year. “Everyone’s talking about how important it is to stop the violence, but we can’t do that just by saying it’s bad. We need laws, and to be strict,” says Razou. She says few women she meets press charges against their abuser, and those who do often retract their claims, swayed by a culture that tells women that male violence is excusable, as well as a recently passed law that can force women to share custody of their children with their abusers. Data from the Greek justice ministry shows consistently low rates of prosecutions and convictions under a 2006 law criminalising domestic violence. An average of just 3,566 men a year have been prosecuted for domestic violence since 2016. Conviction rates are also low: on average, just 23% of men prosecuted were convicted, and the vast majority received suspended sentences.

It is this environment, campaigners say, that discourages women from reporting domestic violence at all. Anisa’s relatives believe that night in mid-July was the turning point. They say the lack of police intervention allowed the perpetrator to believe he could kill with impunity. The two officers who failed to get out of their car and investigate have since been suspended. “The murder was planned. He knew exactly what he was doing,” says Anisa’s cousin Christina, who wanted to keep her surname private. Christina, an elegant 22-year-old, tries to contain her anger, folding her delicately manicured hands as she speaks. “Then he washed his hands and cleaned himself up. He was very thorough. Then he went to the police. He did exactly what Balaskas said,” she says, referring to a senior member of Greece’s police union.   Rape reporting figures   Stavros Balaskas made headlines after the murder of the British-born Caroline Crouch by her husband, Charalambos “Babis” Anagnostopoulos, in June. Anagnostopoulos confessed following a month-long manhunt after initially blaming the murder on a gang of robbers, and was arrested at Crouch’s memorial service. The incident captured the Greek news cycle, so much so that most people refer to Crouch just by her first name, a byword for violence against women.     Caroline Crouch, 20, whose husband has confessed to her murder. Photograph: REX/Shutterstock    For more than five weeks, Anagnostopoulos, a flight instructor, had maintained the crime was the result of a robbery, in which he and Crouch had been tied up and gagged, until he admitted he had fabricated the story to conceal the killing. In a television interview later that month, Balaskas claimed that if Anagnostopoulos had confessed immediately, he may have received a reduced sentence. “It was an unfortunate event, committed in anger, and he lost it and went crazy. If he had just called the police, he would have gotten four years in prison,” he said. “If the moment this man killed Caroline, he called [the police] and said, ‘I had a fight with my wife and I killed her,’ he would have had a different kind of treatment.” A number of femicides that occurred after Balaskas’s statement involved perpetrators immediately telling the police what they had done. Victims’ families believe his statements emboldened would-be perpetrators, enabling the idea that accused men can sway courts by displaying behaviour that match the clauses in the penal code. “Don’t advise future murderers and make their lives easier,” says Christina.    I told the police: ‘My mother called so many times. How could you let this happen?’  Sofia Karasachinidou     Balaskas claimed the quote was taken out of context, and shrugged off any suggestion that, unintentionally or otherwise, his statement acted as a guide for violent men. “I have a name as a tough guy,” he said. “I have a reputation for this. Some people want to use this against me, but people who know me understand.” He said combating the rise in domestic violence in Greece required women to speak up. Other victims’ families say Balakas’s statement epitomises a macho culture in the Hellenic police that often fails to take domestic violence seriously, producing gaps in policing that enable femicide. “There’s no option to talk – that’s why women don’t talk. Our society is patriarchal,” says Sofia Karasachinidou, who, with her sister, Maria, is mourning their mother, who was shot by their father earlier this year. The two women say their father terrorised their family since they were young, but his brutal attacks on their mother increased after their divorce in 2017, sometimes even taking place publicly. The sisters estimate that their mother reported their father to the police at least eight times after the divorce, including once in 2018 when their father filed a counter-claim that led to the pair being held in the same cell overnight. The police, they say, then just advised their mother to avoid their father, in their Athens suburb of Agia Varvara, but offered no other solutions. In June, their father shot their mother in the shoulder and head, fatally wounding her. When Sofia arrived at the police cordon around the crime scene, she struggled to convince officers their father was responsible. “I told the police, ‘My mother called so many times. How could you let this happen?’” says Sofia. “They do nothing for domestic violence. They don’t care.” Their father turned himself in the day after the shooting and will stand trial for homicide as well as illegal possession of a firearm. The sisters fear he will receive a lenient sentence. “We are both afraid for our lives,” says Maria. The Hellenic police are attempting to change how they handle domestic violence after Greece signed the Istanbul convention on violence against women two years ago. This includes a new department to monitor how the police process domestic violence complaints as well as setting up a network of 72 police stations across the country where at least one or two officers are trained in how to treat survivors of abuse.   Related: Violence against women ‘a pandemic’, warns UN envoy     Yet Sofia Kyriacou, an officer in the new police department, denies that the Hellenic police have historically had problems aiding survivors of domestic violence. “Sometimes it’s useful to criticise and focus on problems, but this means you will not focus on things going well,” she says. “Many police officers do their best and more within their responsibilities to help these victims.” Feminist activists paint a different picture, saying that violence against women has reached such epidemic proportions in Greece that they are left with no other option than to intervene. Traditionally at odds with a police force that Amnesty International accused of flouting international human rights law in its alleged abuse of protesters and minorities, activists said they are now working with the police to change attitudes towards domestic violence and make it easier for women to report these crimes. The feminist group Diotima says they have trained at least 150 police officers on how to identify abuse, how to listen to survivors and what the law proscribes. “Gender-based violence is one end of a continuum. The other end is femicide,” says Anna Vouyioukas of Diotima. “It’s become obvious in Greece. Domestic violence can lead to femicide, and that you cannot change because it means death.” Christina agrees. “The state does nothing for women,” she says, shaking her head. “So many femicides and they do nothing.” In the UK, call the national domestic abuse helpline on 0808 2000 247, or visit Women’s Aid.

Emily Whelan, 25, was found unresponsive in her bedroom in Leeds on 7 November 2016 and pronounced dead the next day at Leeds general infirmary. Her parents were told that Whelan had experienced a seizure, but she had never had any significant issues with the condition she had managed since childhood. Whelan’s parents suspect she could have been killed and believe an individual known to her has questions to answer. Stewart, whose cause of death was also initially attributed to epilepsy in 2010, was found to have been killed by her husband, Ian Stewart, at a trial earlier this year. The re-examination of her death was ordered after Ian Stewart was convicted of murdering his new partner, the children’s author Helen Bailey, in 2017. After Whelan’s death a police investigation concluded there was no third-party involvement and closed the case, while an inquest concluded she had died in “circumstances which were consistent with a nocturnal seizure having precipitated a cardiac arrest”. While West Yorkshire police say that conclusion remains and an investigation has not been formally reopened, the Guardian can reveal the force is approaching another police unit in relation to the murder of Diane Stewart. There is no suggestion Ian Stewart was involved in Whelan’s death. A re-examination of Diane Stewart’s brain revealed it showed signs that “breathing had been restricted” for between 35 minutes and an hour before her death and ultimately helped secure a conviction against her husband.  Whelan’s mother, Caramella Brennan, approached West Yorkshire police with further questions after reading reports about the Stewart case. Brennan said slides of her daughter’s brain tissue had been preserved, meaning similar tests could be conducted. In March she approached the coroner’s service and shortly after was contacted by West Yorkshire police, who confirmed they would be liaising with the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire major crime unit that investigated Stewart’s murder. It is understood the pathologist who conducted the original postmortem, Dr Matthew Lyall, is being considered to re-examine Whelan’s brain tissue. Whelan, a health and social care graduate with an ambition to work with young offenders, had a baby while at university and completed her studies while raising the child and working part-time at a nursery. Investigations into her death were severely hampered by the failings of Leeds teaching hospitals NHS trust to preserve her body. A forensic postmortem was ordered about 10 months after Whelan’s death but when the pathologist came to examine her body, it had decomposed. The pathologist “carefully considered” whether her death could have been caused “by injuries inflicted by another person”. He said his examination of the body was “severely hampered by changes of decomposition”. He said in the absence of obvious traumatic injury, he considered the possibility of an asphyxia death, meaning strangling or smothering.     Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST   He said that in the first examination, the pathologist had mentioned “a few petechiae in the eyes” – tiny red spots that can be a sign of strangulation – but that they were not visible by the time he conducted his own assessment, adding “the decompositional changes could have obscured any that were there”. In a judgment handed down last year, a judge concluded that Leeds teaching hospitals NHS trust had breached human rights laws by failing to preserve Whelan’s body, and awarded the family damages. Brennan told the Guardian: “Despite the breathtaking incompetence of the mortuaries, the coroner’s office and certain police officers during the first look at events surrounding Emily’s death, I’m hopeful the evidence will be found this time around. “There isn’t a day that passes where we don’t think about and miss Emily.” A West Yorkshire police spokesperson said: “We can confirm that we are approaching Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire major crime unit to ask about the circumstances of their investigation into the murder of Diane Stewart, after the case was highlighted to us by the family of Emily Whelan. “At this time there is no change to our previous conclusion that Emily’s death was not suspicious with no third-party involvement.”",mother woman epilepsy died hope highprofile murder diane stewart could hold key establishing daughter ’ cause death emily whelan found unresponsive bedroom leeds november pronounced dead next day leeds general infirmary parent told whelan experienced seizure never significant issue condition managed since childhood whelan ’ parent suspect could killed believe individual known question answer stewart whose cause death also initially attributed epilepsy found killed husband ian stewart trial earlier year reexamination death ordered ian stewart convicted murdering new partner child ’ author helen bailey whelan ’ death police investigation concluded thirdparty involvement closed case inquest concluded died “ circumstance consistent nocturnal seizure precipitated cardiac arrest ” west yorkshire police say conclusion remains investigation formally reopened guardian reveal force approaching another police unit relation murder diane stewart suggestion ian stewart involved whelan ’ death reexamination diane stewart ’ brain revealed showed sign “ breathing restricted ” minute hour death ultimately helped secure conviction husband whelan ’ mother caramella brennan approached west yorkshire police question reading report stewart case brennan said slide daughter ’ brain tissue preserved meaning similar test could conducted march approached coroner ’ service shortly contacted west yorkshire police confirmed would liaising bedfordshire cambridgeshire hertfordshire major crime unit investigated stewart ’ murder understood pathologist conducted original postmortem dr matthew lyall considered reexamine whelan ’ brain tissue whelan health social care graduate ambition work young offender baby university completed study raising child working parttime nursery investigation death severely hampered failing leeds teaching hospital nh trust preserve body forensic postmortem ordered month whelan ’ death pathologist came examine body decomposed pathologist “ carefully considered ” whether death could caused “ injury inflicted another person ” said examination body “ severely hampered change decomposition ” said absence obvious traumatic injury considered possibility asphyxia death meaning strangling smothering sign first edition free daily newsletter – every weekday morning bst said first examination pathologist mentioned “ petechia eye ” – tiny red spot sign strangulation – visible time conducted assessment adding “ decompositional change could obscured ” judgment handed last year judge concluded leeds teaching hospital nh trust breached human right law failing preserve whelan ’ body awarded family damage brennan told guardian “ despite breathtaking incompetence mortuary coroner ’ office certain police officer first look event surrounding emily ’ death ’ hopeful evidence found time around “ ’ day pass ’ think miss emily ” west yorkshire police spokesperson said “ confirm approaching bedfordshire cambridgeshire hertfordshire major crime unit ask circumstance investigation murder diane stewart case highlighted u family emily whelan “ time change previous conclusion emily ’ death suspicious thirdparty involvement ”,leeds,"Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, United Kingdom","(53.7974185, -1.5437941, 0.0)",53.7974185,-1.5437941,0.0

Lancaster died suddenly and unexpectedly on Tuesday morning, according to a statement posted by the Sophie Lancaster Foundation on social media, a charity founded in her daughter’s memory. The charity said: “It is with great shock and disbelief that we announce that Sylvia Lancaster has passed away. “She died early this morning in Blackburn hospital. She had suffered from ill-health for the last couple of years, but her death was sudden and unexpected. Sylvia had such a powerful life force; we cannot imagine a world without her in it.”     Sophie Lancaster. Photograph: Lancashire police/PA    The charity added that after her daughter’s murder Lancaster “put her energy into championing people from alternative subcultures and creating educational programmes to tackle prejudice and intolerance”. Sophie Lancaster was murdered and her boyfriend, Robert Maltby, badly beaten in what a judge described as a “feral” and “savage” attack by teenagers in Lancashire in August 2007. The foundation added: “She worked tirelessly to combat the inaccurate and lazy stereotyping that all too often leads to violent prejudice and promoted a culture of celebrating difference; something that leads to safer communities for us all.” Lancaster’s death comes a few weeks after one of the murderers of her daughter was due to be released from jail, which Lancaster said she was “very disappointed” to hear. Ryan Herbert, who was 16 at time time, was jailed for life in 2008 for murdering Sophie Lancaster in a park in Lancashire and was ordered to serve a minimum of 16 years. On appeal, his sentence was reduced to 14 and a half years. However, the parole board decided in mid-March that Herbert could be released on licence. In an interview with the Guardian shortly before her death, Lancaster, speaking of her daughter’s murder and the decision for Herbert to be released from prison, said she had not been given an explanation for the decision and that she felt the views of bereaved families were often ignored by the justice system. She added: “Fourteen years ago he was given a 16-year sentence. What are they saying? Are they saying that the crime is not as important as it was then? I find that quite a difficult concept to deal with.”",sylvia lancaster mother yearold woman murdered dressed goth died lancaster died suddenly unexpectedly tuesday morning according statement posted sophie lancaster foundation social medium charity founded daughter ’ memory charity said “ great shock disbelief announce sylvia lancaster passed away “ died early morning blackburn hospital suffered illhealth last couple year death sudden unexpected sylvia powerful life force imagine world without ” sophie lancaster photograph lancashire policepa charity added daughter ’ murder lancaster “ put energy championing people alternative subculture creating educational programme tackle prejudice intolerance ” sophie lancaster murdered boyfriend robert maltby badly beaten judge described “ feral ” “ savage ” attack teenager lancashire august foundation added “ worked tirelessly combat inaccurate lazy stereotyping often lead violent prejudice promoted culture celebrating difference something lead safer community u ” lancaster ’ death come week one murderer daughter due released jail lancaster said “ disappointed ” hear ryan herbert time time jailed life murdering sophie lancaster park lancashire ordered serve minimum year appeal sentence reduced half year however parole board decided midmarch herbert could released licence interview guardian shortly death lancaster speaking daughter ’ murder decision herbert released prison said given explanation decision felt view bereaved family often ignored justice system added “ fourteen year ago given year sentence saying saying crime important find quite difficult concept deal ”,,"None, Torino, Piemonte, Italia","(44.933143, 7.540121, 0.0)",44.933143,7.540121,0.0

But a year on from Everard’s death, the parents of Spinks have delivered a stark warning that mistakes are still being made in the cases such as their daughter’s. “After everything that happened last year, the perception of the police with the general public is really low at the moment,” said her father, Richard Spinks. “They’ve got to realise people don’t trust them. They’ve got to do something, they’ve got to make some changes.” The 23-year-old’s family remember her as a young woman who lived a life full to the brim, spending most of her spare time tending to her horse, Paddy, and taking him to competitions. She played the piano, painted, worked as a swimming teacher and had a busy social life. There simply wasn’t time for a boyfriend.  “She had her whole life mapped out. I say this all the time, but she did light up the room wherever she went. Everybody took to her,” Spinks added. “She was a very talented girl.”  The family often reflect on the chain of events that led Gracie’s death, and how things could have turned out differently. As well as her many hobbies, she juggled multiple jobs in and around Old Whittington, in Chesterfield, while studying, said her mother, Alison Heaton.  So it was no surprise that when Covid hit, Gracie struggled to sit at home on furlough and found a job at a local e-commerce company, Xbite.  It was at Xbite that she met 35-year-old Michael Sellers, her supervisor, who asked her out for dinner. The pair met a handful of times, but Gracie soon decided she was too busy for a relationship and ended things. But Sellers had become infatuated with her. She told her parents that he would bombard colleagues with hundreds of messages asking questions about her. At one point he spent £15,000 on a white Scirocco, which Gracie had told him was her favourite type of car. But it was the morning she found him waiting for her before work at the field where she kept her horse that she decided to report him to her employer. “She said, ‘It’s really spooking my mum’, and I think she’d decided then enough was enough,” said Heaton. “But I think she was a bit nervous to complain about him because he was her supervisor.” After her complaint, Sellers was fired from his job. Gracie was advised to report him to the police, but chose not to pursue a restraining order and asked police to caution him instead.  Gracie had no more contact with Sellers, and as far as she and her family were concerned, the problem was dealt with. “He was completely off the radar. We had drawn a line under it all and thought, ‘That’s it,’” said Heaton. A few months later, on the morning of 18 June 2021, Gracie left the house in a rush. “She said she’d not got time to drink her tea and actually took it with her in one of the mugs,” said Heaton, who remembers every detail of that morning. When she got a call to say Gracie had been found lying in the field, covered in blood, her first thought was that a horse had kicked her. An inquest revealed she died from a stab wound to the neck, and police believe Sellers – who was found dead in a nearby field – killed Gracie. “It’s probably the worst thing that can happen in your life. Nobody wants to see their children die, especially in that way,” said Spinks. It later emerged that around a month prior to the attack, a rucksack containing weapons – a hammer, axe and knives – as well as Viagra had been found across the road from the field and handed in to Derbyshire constabulary. An investigation after Gracie’s death revealed that documentation in the bag, which Sellers frequently carried to work, had details on it linking it to his family home. The force is now being investigated by the police watchdog over its handling of Gracie’s original complaint against Sellers, and the rucksack. A police sergeant and two constables were served with misconduct notices in November. “Them admitting that they failed, it doesn’t alter anything for us. I just want them to say it. Because it’s ruined our life, absolutely ruined our lives,” said Heaton. In the months since Gracie’s death, her parents and the local community have thrown themselves into a campaign to get more funding for stalking advocates, and have gathered more than 100,000 signatures on a petition, which prompted a debate in parliament. “When Gracie was killed, it was the last straw for me. I was appalled. I started the petition and the response was overwhelming,” said local campaigner Jackie Barnett-Wheatcroft, who has now set up a charity, Stalking Victims Support UK, to continue pushing for change in Gracie’s memory. “We’re doing this for the past victims and the future victims. It doesn’t feel like the police, or government, are learning from past mistakes, and we need to change that.” In a significant win for their campaign, last month Derbyshire constabulary said it was recruiting a stalking coordinator in response to rising cases, and to ensure investigations are properly carried out. “We’ve achieved something already, but we want it across the board, with all constabularies. A lot of police forces now have sat up and thought they need to do something about this.” said Spinks. “People say to us: ‘You’re doing really well, I don’t know how you can do all this.’ And I think, ‘Well, we’ve got to do it.’ How can we say we’re not going do anything about it? We’ve got to make a difference.” The couple take solace in the fact that Paddy is now being cared for by Gracie’s best friend, Ben, thanks to a fundraising drive after her death.

She is missed each and every day and we will keep her in our hearts and minds always.”",gracie spinks loved – feeding beloved horse one morning work – stalker previously reported police killed death came month sarah everard murdered police officer wayne couzens march triggering nationwide conversation violence towards woman confidence policing year everard ’ death parent spinks delivered stark warning mistake still made case daughter ’ “ everything happened last year perception police general public really low moment ” said father richard spinks “ ’ got realise people ’ trust ’ got something ’ got make change ” yearold ’ family remember young woman lived life full brim spending spare time tending horse paddy taking competition played piano painted worked swimming teacher busy social life simply ’ time boyfriend “ whole life mapped say time light room wherever went everybody took ” spinks added “ talented girl ” family often reflect chain event led gracie ’ death thing could turned differently well many hobby juggled multiple job around old whittington chesterfield studying said mother alison heaton surprise covid hit gracie struggled sit home furlough found job local ecommerce company xbite xbite met yearold michael seller supervisor asked dinner pair met handful time gracie soon decided busy relationship ended thing seller become infatuated told parent would bombard colleague hundred message asking question one point spent £ white scirocco gracie told favourite type car morning found waiting work field kept horse decided report employer “ said ‘ ’ really spooking mum ’ think ’ decided enough enough ” said heaton “ think bit nervous complain supervisor ” complaint seller fired job gracie advised report police chose pursue restraining order asked police caution instead gracie contact seller far family concerned problem dealt “ completely radar drawn line thought ‘ ’ ’ ” said heaton month later morning june gracie left house rush “ said ’ got time drink tea actually took one mug ” said heaton remembers every detail morning got call say gracie found lying field covered blood first thought horse kicked inquest revealed died stab wound neck police believe seller – found dead nearby field – killed gracie “ ’ probably worst thing happen life nobody want see child die especially way ” said spinks later emerged around month prior attack rucksack containing weapon – hammer axe knife – well viagra found across road field handed derbyshire constabulary investigation gracie ’ death revealed documentation bag seller frequently carried work detail linking family home force investigated police watchdog handling gracie ’ original complaint seller rucksack police sergeant two constable served misconduct notice november “ admitting failed ’ alter anything u want say ’ ruined life absolutely ruined life ” said heaton month since gracie ’ death parent local community thrown campaign get funding stalking advocate gathered signature petition prompted debate parliament “ gracie killed last straw appalled started petition response overwhelming ” said local campaigner jackie barnettwheatcroft set charity stalking victim support uk continue pushing change gracie ’ memory “ ’ past victim future victim ’ feel like police government learning past mistake need change ” significant win campaign last month derbyshire constabulary said recruiting stalking coordinator response rising case ensure investigation properly carried “ ’ achieved something already want across board constabulary lot police force sat thought need something ” said spinks “ people say u ‘ ’ really well ’ know ’ think ‘ well ’ got ’ say ’ going anything ’ got make difference ” couple take solace fact paddy cared gracie ’ best friend ben thanks fundraising drive death related gracie spinks death officer served notice handling stalking report “ ’ never get happened gracie ’ never accept ” said spinks “ feel ’ mission make change ” derbyshire constabulary said “ continue support fully cooperate iopc investigation circumstance leading tragic death gracie “ keeping iopc date number improvement implemented recent month would encourage victim stalking harassment report incident u investigation ” xbite said “ gracie always part work family missed every day keep heart mind always ”,uk,United Kingdom,"(54.7023545, -3.2765753, 0.0)",54.7023545,-3.2765753,0.0

Jack Woodley was punched, kicked, stamped on and fatally stabbed by the boys, none of whom he knew. All had denied murder. On Wednesday, after a 78-day trial at Newcastle crown court, a jury found all of the boys, who cannot be identified, guilty. Woodley’s mother, Zoey McGill, said that as well her son securing his own accommodation, he was about to start a new job at Amazon. “We were all very proud of Jack and this should have been a very exciting time in his life,” she said. “The devastation of losing Jack is immense and far-reaching. The trauma of reliving this whole incident over a long trial has had a devastating effect on us all. We cannot see a way of recovering from this. We feel imprisoned by our grief and trauma. “No parent, loved one or friend should suffer someone going to a fair and losing them forever. We will never be able to share treasured family moments with our ‘cheeky chappy blue-eyed boy’ ever again.” In October last year, Woodley and his girlfriend had been at the Houghton Feast, an annual festival held in Houghton-le-Spring, Tyne and Wear. The 10 defendants, then aged between 14 and 17, were also there and were looking for trouble, the jury heard. After the fair, the gang “surrounded and isolated” Woodley, covering their heads as they prepared to attack him, prosecutor Mark McKone QC said. The group, he said, “not only attacked him but prevented him from escaping and other people from helping him”. There had been an incident in which a girl was hit and Woodley asked one boy if he knew why, the jury heard. One defendant asked Woodley “if he was starting … this seems to be one of the trivial reasons for the group attack”. All the defendants had also been charged with an alternative count of manslaughter. One of the teenagers had pleaded guilty to manslaughter, admitting that he stabbed Woodley but denying that he intended to kill him. Det Ch Insp Joanne Brooks, the senior investigating officer on the case, said dozens of lives had been destroyed by the events of 16 October 2021. “I want to send an unequivocal message to anyone who chooses to carry a weapon of any kind or believes that violence is acceptable – the consequences can be devastating. “Look at the pain this incident has caused – not only could you take away someone else’s future and destroy the lives of their loved ones, but also your own and those of your family and friends.” She also commended the bravery of numerous young people who witnessed events and came forward to give evidence. The victim’s father, John Woodley, said his heart had been broken into a million pieces. “My son went to a fair with his girlfriend to enjoy a night out and he didn’t come back. The pain and fear he must have endured that night is unthinkable. “Jack had his whole life ahead of him, he was just 18 years old. Those who attacked our Jack get to see their families and have a future, Jack does not. “We visit Jack at his grave and wonder how his life would have been if he was still here.” The 10 defendants were remanded in custody until sentencing in August.",ten teenage boy found guilty murdering yearold walking home funfair day picked key new flat jack woodley punched kicked stamped fatally stabbed boy none knew denied murder wednesday day trial newcastle crown court jury found boy identified guilty woodley ’ mother zoey mcgill said well son securing accommodation start new job amazon “ proud jack exciting time life ” said “ devastation losing jack immense farreaching trauma reliving whole incident long trial devastating effect u see way recovering feel imprisoned grief trauma “ parent loved one friend suffer someone going fair losing forever never able share treasured family moment ‘ cheeky chappy blueeyed boy ’ ever ” october last year woodley girlfriend houghton feast annual festival held houghtonlespring tyne wear defendant aged also looking trouble jury heard fair gang “ surrounded isolated ” woodley covering head prepared attack prosecutor mark mckone qc said group said “ attacked prevented escaping people helping ” incident girl hit woodley asked one boy knew jury heard one defendant asked woodley “ starting … seems one trivial reason group attack ” defendant also charged alternative count manslaughter one teenager pleaded guilty manslaughter admitting stabbed woodley denying intended kill det ch insp joanne brook senior investigating officer case said dozen life destroyed event october “ want send unequivocal message anyone chooses carry weapon kind belief violence acceptable – consequence devastating “ look pain incident caused – could take away someone else ’ future destroy life loved one also family friend ” also commended bravery numerous young people witnessed event came forward give evidence victim ’ father john woodley said heart broken million piece “ son went fair girlfriend enjoy night ’ come back pain fear must endured night unthinkable “ jack whole life ahead year old attacked jack get see family future jack “ visit jack grave wonder life would still ” defendant remanded custody sentencing august,,"None, Torino, Piemonte, Italia","(44.933143, 7.540121, 0.0)",44.933143,7.540121,0.0

According to friends, Azad had had to move home regularly after several death threats by male members of her family. Three weeks ago, her body was found dumped in a ditch outside of the city of Duhok, in the Iraqi autonomous Kurdistan region. Her hands had been tied and she had been shot twice. Police have issued an arrest warrant for her brother, who is believed to have travelled from his home in Germany to carry out the killing. A talented makeup artist, the 23-year-old had supported herself since her family turned its back on her when she was a young teenager. She went to brides’ homes to prepare them for their weddings and built a reputation that earned her a job at a salon in Duhok. “She was such a nice person, and everyone loved her so much,” said a close friend, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “She lived alone because when she went to her family home, they said to Doski, ‘Get out’,” the friend said. “They said, ‘When we see you alone, we will kill you’.” According to the Duhok police, Azad was killed by one of her brothers in what was described as an “honour killing”. Police were called to the village of Mangesh, 12 miles (20km) north of Duhok, according to Iraqi-Kurdish news site Rudaw, by another of Azad’s brothers. The killer had allegedly already returned to Germany. “Our investigation so far suggests that Doski Azad was killed by her brother at a location just outside the city before he managed to flee the crime scene,” Duhok police spokesperson, Hemin Suleiman, said. Azad’s friend said attempts had been made on her life before. “When I called her [a while ago] she didn’t answer me, and later I said, ‘Doski, where you have been?’ And she said, ‘My brother came to kill me and I went to the police.’” Another Kurdish transgender woman was murdered last year by family members, Rudaw reported. Yeksani, a Kurdish rights group, said: “Hate crime against LGBT+ community in the Kurdistan region is on the rise.” The group’s director Zhiar Ali said Azad was one of a few openly transgender women in Kurdistan. “This level of freedom in Kurdistan comes at a risk, and we witnessed this in Doski’s case,” Ali said. “Living openly as an LGBT+ person is deeply stigmatised. “Honour killings are very prevalent. We have hundreds of nameless graves, they are marked with numbers. The victims are so disrespected that, not only are they blamed, but they disrespect them even when they are dead.” Ali was critical of the Kurdish media’s coverage of Azad’s death, some of which used derogatory language. “It was a completely irresponsible and disastrous reporting by the Kurdish media,” Ali said, primarily about the Kurdish-language coverage.   Related: Lives of LGBTQ+ Afghans ‘dramatically worse’ under Taliban rule, finds survey    Rasha Younes, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, said the murder signalled the “climate of impunity” afforded to perpetrators of anti-LGBTQ+ violence, empowered under Iraq’s penal code to cause harm under the pretext of “honour”. “This has a chilling effect on LGBT Iraqis, for whom the law does not offer protection, rendering any ‘suspicion’ of homosexuality or gender variance a cause for potential violence, which not only results in the death of LGBT people but makes their lives unliveable,” she said. Kurdish activist Amed Sherwan said most hate crimes were not reported. “It is very tragic that someone must pay such a price for being herself. It makes me very sad,” he said.  The US, French and German consulates in Erbil condemned the murder on Twitter, as did the UN assistance mission for Iraq and the Canadian mission to Iraq.

Afterwards, many found the verdict hard to accept when it emerged she had pleaded guilty to a series of child cruelty offences against the schoolboy and two of his siblings. But on Thursday, 27 years after Rikki went missing, Neave faced another emotional day in court – this time at the Old Bailey in London, as jurors found 41-year-old James Watson guilty of her son’s murder in November 1994 by a majority verdict. Watson was aged 13 at the time of the murder. The verdict concludes a mystery spanning four decades that at its heart is the sorry tale of a schoolboy whose short life came to a grim end. Rikki was born in 1989, and at the time of his murder was living with his mother and two of his three sisters on the Welland estate in Peterborough. His father and stepfather have both died since his murder.     An artist’s drawing shows James Watson appearing in the dock at the Old Bailey in London. Photograph: Elizabeth Cook/PA    Before his death, Rikki and his family were well known to local social services and Rikki was on the “at risk register”. Prosecutors told jurors in 2022 that the offences to which Neave pleaded guilty amounted to a “broad range of serious, deliberate mistreatment”, adding that “the neglect exposed one so young to grave risk”. Rikki was used as a “courier” to buy drugs for his mother, they said, who was a heavy user of amphetamine sulphate, also known as speed. He would be sent out after midnight with a note to a drug dealer asking for “sherbet” – her euphemism for amphetamines. Her conviction for cruelty offences led to a major overhaul of Cambridgeshire social services, which was exposed a riven by disputes and overworked. But Neave has since denied the severity of the allegations. She told jurors in February 2022 that she only pleaded guilty because she was “bullied into it” and thought she was pleading guilty to smacking her children. On Monday 28 November 1994, Rikki left his home alone at about 9.30am. He did not attend school. At 6pm, Neave telephoned 999 to report her son missing. At midday on the following day, his body was found by PC Malcolm Graham in a wooded area, five minutes walk from his home. The body was naked. Lying on the ground, flat on his back, Rikki had been deliberately posed by the killer in a star shape, with outstretched arms and legs placed wide apart.     Police at the scene where the body of Rikki Neave was discovered in undergrowth less than 500 yards from his home.  Photograph: PA    On Wednesday 30 November, the missing clothing was found. Further examination revealed Rikki had been strangled by the neckline of his own zipped-up jacket, pulled back hard against his throat from behind. On 24 May 1995, roughly six months after Rikki disappeared, his mother was charged with his murder as well as the cruelty offences. Neave’s guilty pleas to five specimen charges of cruelty, as well as one of burglary and another of supplying amphetamines, were kept from the jury during her trial for murder. The prosecution had alleged she murdered her son as a human sacrifice to win back her husband, Dean, who did not get on with the boy. They also alleged she had told neighbours she was an occult priestess and she had strangled him, washed the body and laid him out in a manner similar to that of Leonardo da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man; the famous image was found in a book in her house. Jumping forward to 2022, Neave denies ever claiming to be an occult priestess, although she concedes she owned a number of books on the subject of dark magic and the occult. Jurors in 1996 cleared her of the murder. In 2022, prosecutors conceded the not-guilty verdict against Neave was correct, adding: “The decision to charge her with his murder was wrong.”     Ruth Neave pictured in 2016. She had pressured police to reopen the case. Photograph: Ben Kendall/PA    The detective in charge of the reinvestigation, Paul Fullwood, added that the case against her was a “fanciful hypothesis”. Rikki’s death became a “cold case” – formally suspended and unsolved – until pressure from Neave and her husband, Gary Rogers, resulted in it being reopened in 2015. Fullwood, now retired, and his team discovered a series of tapings – effectively sellotape applied to Rikki’s clothing – taken as evidence in 1994. They were sent for examination using techniques unavailable at the time of the original investigation. The tests found the DNA of someone called James Lewis Watson, who was 13 at the time of Rikki’s disappearance. Prosecutors described the discovery as a “turning point”. Watson was not a stranger to the inquiries. The police interviewed him as a witness on 5 December 1994 after he was seen with Rikki by two separate witnesses on the day of the disappearance. The finding of his DNA led in February 2016 to the designation of Watson as a suspect for the killing and to the start of a reappraisal of all evidence in the case. In his first account of that meeting with Rikki, Watson made no mention of any physical contact between himself and the younger boy. But nearly 24 yearslater in April 2016, Watson, interviewed under caution as a murder suspect, changed his account – specifically that he lifted Rikki up to look over a fence at a nearby digger. Detectives say the fence did not exist. They were becoming more convinced that they may finally have identified Rikki’s killer. Born on 1 April 1981, Watson was living in care at the time of Rikki’s disappearance at a children’s home called Woodgates, about 20 miles east of Peterborough. Watson was a persistent truant and those who then knew him have since described unusual behaviours that paint a picture of a troubled boy. Allegations included that he indecently touched a boy of five, was suspected of masturbating over images of young children, and repeatedly put his hands round the neck of a teenage girl during sex. He also appeared to have a grotesque interest in the subject of child murder. In the aftermath of Rikki’s death, teachers revealed he made several photocopies of the front page of the Peterborough Evening Telegraph, which showed a photograph of Rikki, and claimed they were for display in the children’s home. Watson’s own mother told officers in 1994 about a disturbing conversation she had with her son about the murder of a child – three days before Rikki disappeared. As Watson grew older, he amassed a long list of criminal offences, including sexually assaulting a man in 2018. His other convictions included arson, carrying a firearm in a public place, damaging property, using threatening words or behaviour, handling stolen property, possession of cannabis, taking a motor vehicle without consent, and 17 theft and 11 burglary convictions. After his formal arrest on suspicion of Rikki’s murder, he fled the country in the back of a camper van owned by an acquaintance he had met in a probation hostel. He ended up in Portugal, from where he was extradited to the UK in 2016. It was not until February 2020 that he was finally charged with Rikki’s murder, and due to legal challenges and the Covid pandemic he did not stand trial until January this year. Giving evidence, Watson was quietly spoken, mild-mannered and almost contrite with regards to his earlier offending. But he frequently tied himself in knots in the witness box, contradicting his own evidence, providing an account of events only to then say he could not remember. Finally, on Thursday, the 27-year mystery of Rikki’s death was solved with the conviction of Watson at the Old Bailey.

society/2021/oct/02/the-81-women-killed-in-28-weeks,article,uk-news,UK news,2021-10-02T19:20:32Z,The 81 women killed in 28 weeks,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/oct/02/the-81-women-killed-in-28-weeks,https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2021/oct/02/the-81-women-killed-in-28-weeks,False,pillar/news,News,"People said something had changed with the awful death of Sarah Everard. But the message certainly hasn’t reached the men who rape, harm and kill women. And I can’t see a difference in the government, police, Crown Prosecution Service or the judiciary either. Since Sarah Everard was abducted, raped, murdered and, in the words of her mother, “disposed of as if she were rubbish”, at least 81 other UK women have been killed in circumstances where the suspect is a man. It is absolutely ludicrous that we know this because of my work, a random northern woman in east London, not the government, not the National Police Chiefs Council. Each of these women will have died in terror and pain, just like Sarah. Each one leaves behind grieving friends and family for whom the loss will last a lifetime. It is significant that Sarah was killed by a serving police officer, but I wish the suffering of these women, and the anguish of those who loved them, were not accepted as normal and inevitable.     Sarah Everard. Photograph: Metropolitan Police/Reuters    Men’s fatal violence against women cuts across all sections of society, across ages, class and ethnicity. But some women are afforded more empathy than others. Some are more likely to be disbelieved, to be blamed, to be sent away without the help they need. This appalling hierarchy of victims continues into death. It is almost always the young, conventionally attractive, middle-class white woman killed by a stranger, the perfect victim, that makes the front pages. Not the 50-year-old from a council estate in Leicestershire, killed by the father of her children after a 30-year marriage, where her life and dignity have been chipped away, little by little, every day. Perhaps until she found the strength to leave him and he chose to exercise the ultimate form of control. I want every woman’s death to be a reason for soul-searching.        I started Counting Dead Women in January 2012, after the murder of 20-year-old Kirsty Treloar, who had been referred to the charity of which I am chief executive, when she was trying to leave her violent boyfriend. A year and a half later, Clarrie O’Callaghan and I had our first conversation, one that would lead to the development of the Femicide Census. We’ve made Freedom of Information requests going back to 2009 about men’s fatal violence against women. From this we’ve identified that 62% of women killed by men are killed by a partner or ex-partner, and that at least a third of these women were in the process of leaving, or had left him; that teenage girls, as well as women in their 80s or 90s, can be killed by men who were supposed to love them; that 92% of women who are killed by men are killed by someone they know. One in 12 is a woman who is killed by her son.   Related: End femicide: 278 dead – the hidden scandal of older women killed by men    Black women are disproportionately victimised, yet more likely to receive a sub-standard response from state agencies. And Sarah Everard was the 16th woman to be killed by a serving or former police officer since 2009. Has something changed since Sarah Everard was abducted, raped, murdered and disposed of by Wayne Couzens? The government has published the third national strategy to tackle violence against women that doesn’t name men as the perpetrators in the title. It names high-profile victims in the introduction but doesn’t name femicide. It is a folly if we set an ambition to end men’s violence against women and girls if we cannot name women as disproportionally the victims and men as overwhelmingly the perpetrators of sexual and domestic violence and abuse. The Observer and Femicide Census’s End Femicide campaign is important. The media plays a huge role in shaping people’s attitudes and understanding and it is to the Observer’s credit that it is looking at femicide in depth. Femicide is not just homicide of women by men, it’s about how and why women are killed and how this is different from when men are killed. Understanding this is a key step towards ending femicide.

Damien Bendall, 31, is now alleged to have raped and murdered Lacey Bennett. He was previously charged with killing her and her brother, John Paul Bennett, 13, their mother, Terri Harris, 35, and Lacey’s friend, Connie Gent, 11. The victims were discovered at a house in Killamarsh, near Sheffield, on 19 September. The murder charges allege Bendall killed all four on a day between Friday 17 September and Monday 20 September. Bendall was due before Nottingham crown court on Friday for a plea hearing, but failed to appear and the case was adjourned to 4 January at the crown court in Derby. An inquest opening at Chesterfield coroner’s court previously heard the four died as a result of a “violent attack”. A spokesperson for Derbyshire constabulary said the provisional cause of death for the four victims had been identified as “blunt force trauma”. The coroner’s court also heard how a relative of Bendall had phoned police to say the defendant had sustained a self-inflicted stab wound. In a statement, the CPS said: “The Crown Prosecution Service has authorised a further charge for Damien Bendall, 31, after reviewing a file of evidence from Derbyshire police. He has now been charged with rape of a girl under 13. “The additional charge was today confirmed to the court at a hearing held at Nottingham crown court. All are reminded that criminal proceedings against the defendant are active and that he has the right to a fair trial. “It is extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.” Family members said Connie was at a sleepover at the home of her best friend, Lacey, when they were killed. Speaking shortly after their deaths, Jason Bennett, the father of John Paul and Lacey, said: “Life will never be the same again. Families have been left broken by the awful loss of John, Lacey, Terri and Connie.” He described John Paul as “loving, fiery, funny and passionate, with the most beautiful caring heart you could find” and said Lacey was his “TikTok queen, creating dance after dance”.",man accused murdering mother three child also charged raping one victim damien bendall alleged raped murdered lacey bennett previously charged killing brother john paul bennett mother terri harris lacey ’ friend connie gent victim discovered house killamarsh near sheffield september murder charge allege bendall killed four day friday september monday september bendall due nottingham crown court friday plea hearing failed appear case adjourned january crown court derby inquest opening chesterfield coroner ’ court previously heard four died result “ violent attack ” spokesperson derbyshire constabulary said provisional cause death four victim identified “ blunt force trauma ” coroner ’ court also heard relative bendall phoned police say defendant sustained selfinflicted stab wound statement cps said “ crown prosecution service authorised charge damien bendall reviewing file evidence derbyshire police charged rape girl “ additional charge today confirmed court hearing held nottingham crown court reminded criminal proceeding defendant active right fair trial “ extremely important reporting commentary sharing information online could way prejudice proceeding ” family member said connie sleepover home best friend lacey killed speaking shortly death jason bennett father john paul lacey said “ life never family left broken awful loss john lacey terri connie ” described john paul “ loving fiery funny passionate beautiful caring heart could find ” said lacey “ tiktok queen creating dance dance ”,sheffield,"Sheffield, Sheffield City Region, England, United Kingdom","(53.3806626, -1.4702278, 0.0)",53.3806626,-1.4702278,0.0
uk-news/2021/jun/17/greek-husband-confesses-to-of-british-woman,article,world,World news,2021-06-18T16:11:09Z,Greek husband confesses to murder of British woman,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jun/17/greek-husband-confesses-to-of-british-woman,https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2021/jun/17/greek-husband-confesses-to-of-british-woman,False,pillar/news,News,"Greeks have been left reeling after the husband of a British-born student confessed and was charged with her murder, a crime he had previously blamed on a robbery. In a dramatic twist to a case that has gripped the country since Caroline Crouch was strangled next to her baby daughter, investigators announced late on Thursday that Babis Anagnostopoulos had admitted to the murder. “The culprit is her 33-year-old husband who has confessed to the act,” the Greek police tweeted. Anagnostopoulos, who appeared in court on Friday handcuffed and wearing a bulletproof vest, was charged with intentional homicide and abuse of an animal, after the family dog was also found killed. Crouch, who had met the man she would go on to marry as a teenager on the Greek island of Alonissos where her parents have long lived, was 20. Initially the helicopter pilot had blamed his wife’s death on ruthless “foreign” robbers who had broken into the couple’s suburban Athens home, a version of events he had maintained for more than five weeks. He claimed he had been blindfolded and tied to a bed, drifting in and out of consciousness as he watched the crime unfold. “Everything was staged for the crime scene to look like the scene of a robbery,” Costas Hassiotis, the director of the greater Athens homicide division, told reporters, adding that the suspect had tied his own hands and those of his dead wife. Speaking outside court, Vassilis Spyrou, Anagnostopoulos’s lawyer, confirmed that his client had confessed to the crime, adding that he had expressed remorse for his actions. “He’s in a very bad psychological state,” Spyrou had earlier told Alpha TV. “He knows what he has done, he has admitted to the crime.” Nikos Rigas, the deputy chairman of the police officers’ association of Athens, told state TV that examination of mobile devices, a smartwatch, and cameras had established a timeline that revealed inconsistencies in the pilot’s account. “(The suspect) tried to create a crime scene environment that looked convincing: the dog was killed, and his baby was placed next to the body of the murdered mother,” Rigas said. Anagnostopoulos, who was in Alonissos attending a memorial service for Crouch at which he was photographed hugging the victim’s mother, was arrested after being flown to the Greek capital on a police helicopter on Thursday. When police initially picked him up he was told a suspect had been identified, but not that it was him. It was not the first time he had been called to the police headquarters to give testimony. But this time the police had evidence – in the form of data gleaned from Caroline’s smartwatch and the pilot’s mobile phone – that Anagnostopoulos had killed his wife. A pulse monitor on the watch showed she was dead at a time before he claimed the raid had taken place, while a fitness app on his phone proved he was moving around the house at the time he said he had been blindfolded and tied up. In both cases, the findings conflicted with the timeline of events the professional pilot had previously given. A memory card removed at 1.20am from the security camera of the couple’s home, several hours before 4.30am when he claimed the thieves had broken in, provided further evidence. Presented with the new data, Anagnostopoulos admitted to the murder, telling the detectives their relationship had grown increasingly stormy and he had killed Crouch in a fit of rage after she had threatened to leave him, police said. “I had to appear persuasive and so I strangled the dog too,” he was reported as saying in extracts of testimony released by police to the Greek media. The seven-month-old puppy was hanged from a banister in the couple’s home. Few crimes in living memory have outraged Greeks so deeply and for 37 days the pilot had appeared distraught, telling police he had “begged for their lives” as the thieves pointed a pistol at Lydia, his daughter’s temple, and telling the press he hoped no family had to experience the same ordeal. “They were so happy, so in love,” Alonissos’ mayor Petros Vafinis told the Guardian at the time. “The shock in our little community is immense.”     Police workers at the home of Caroline Crouch in an Athens suburb. Photograph: Eurokinissi/Rex/Shutterstock    Athens’ citizens protection minister, Michalis Chrysohoidis, said within hours of the 11 May murder being made public: “We rarely encounter such brutality in Greece, both in Greek society and in crime.” In a rare step, the government declared a €300,000 reward for information that might lead to the capture of the culprits. Images of Anagnostopoulos attending his wife’s funeral cradling their 11-month-old baby resonated far and wide. So, too, did his heartrending eulogy given by Caroline’s graveside. “I am lucky that I met you, very lucky that you loved me and even more lucky that you are the mother of my child,” he had said. “Lydia will grow up not remembering her wonderful mother, but Caroline who was the joy of life will always be near me, through Lydia.” His confession was quick to elicit rage. Overnight Greeks flooded social media with messages of condemnation and calls for justice, while the mainstream media expressed shock not only at the hypocrisy of “this accomplished actor” but the willingness of so many, including senior Greek justice officials, to go along with his story that hardened “Albanian and Georgian” criminals were to blame for the murder. “The pandemic of sympathy for the professional, respected father who, tied up, saw his young wife being murdered in front of his child has collapsed like a tower of cards,” the leftwing newspaper Efsyn wrote in an editorial. “Along with it the far-right propaganda about foreign thieves committing heinous crimes has collapsed too.” On Friday, the case was being likened to that of Oscar Pistorius, the South African sprinter who was convicted in 2015 of fatally shooting his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, in his Pretoria home. “We have experienced the Greek version of the Pistorius case, it has almost the same characteristics,” Giorgos Kalliakmanis, who heads the union of police employees in west Attica told state-run TV.

Maher Maaroufe, 22, of no fixed address, has been charged with 19-year-old Thanwani’s murder as well as assaulting an emergency worker, the Metropolitan police said. Maaroufe, a Tunisian national, who is not a student, will appear at Highbury Corner magistrates court on Tuesday. Police officers were called to Arbour House in Sebastian Street in central London at about 5am on Saturday, where Thanwani, who was studying psychology at City University, was found suffering serious injuries. She was pronounced dead at the scene. A postmortem examination carried out at the Whittington hospital, north London, on Monday gave the cause of death as sharp force trauma to the neck. On Monday, Thanwani’s family paid tribute to her, adding they pray that “there will come a day when girls and women are safe”. In a statement issued through police, they described the 19-year-old as “an angel” who “was pure and did not see bad in anyone”. “Sabita Thanwani was our daughter. Our angel,” they said. “Her life, that we hoped would be long, was cut tragically short. She was ripped away from those who loved her so very dearly; her mum, dad, brother, grandparents, extended family and friends. “Sabita was the most caring and loving person we have ever known. She inspired us every day of her precious 19 years of life.” They continued: “In her short life, she helped so many. Sabita was pure and did not see bad in anyone, because there was no badness in her own awesome heart. “We will never ever stop loving or missing our beautiful, irreplaceable Sabita.

She took a knife from the kitchen and stabbed David Jackson multiple times before handing herself in to police. The details were among those aired in a trial that has captured the public imagination for its insight into the complex motives of a retired accountant who killed her husband of 24 years, a retired army lieutenant colonel, at their home in a Somerset village. The trial was seen as a test of criminal courts’ attitudes to claims of coercive control in domestic homicide cases.  On Friday Penelope Jackson, 66, was found guilty of murder at Bristol crown court. She had admitted manslaughter but denied murdering her husband, 78, on grounds that he had physically abused and coercively controlled her for years. The jury was asked to decide whether, despite a seemingly lucid admission to the police that she had killed him, years of feeling gradually corroded by emotional and physical abuse had resulted in Jackson losing control of herself that night. Jackson was represented by the prominent lawyer Clare Wade QC, who is also conducting an independent review for the government around the sentencing of domestic homicide. In a 2010 case, Wade obtained a manslaughter conviction for Sally Challen, who killed her husband after experiencing years of coercive control. Jackson’s case centred on the evening of 13 February, when the couple shared a celebratory meal kit with their daughter and her husband via a four-hour Zoom call at their home in Berrow, Somerset. The daughter, Isabelle Potterton, 31, said the atmosphere was initially “lovely” but deteriorated when Jackson brought out a bubble and squeak side to go with the steak main course, prompting an argument over whether anyone wanted to eat it. Potterton, who is Jackson’s child from a previous marriage but was raised by the couple, said she was used to her stubborn and hot-tempered parents bickering regularly. “I rolled my eyes and thought ‘they’re just being silly’.” Shortly after ending the call, Potterton received a strange text message from her mother which read: “If it all goes tits, you have this message. I love you to the ends of the earth.” She rang to check she was OK and was told that she was. But later that evening Jackson took a kitchen knife to her bedroom, initially as self-defence, she told the trial. She said she later considered using it to kill herself, and walked into her husband’s bedroom to tell him. She told the court: “I wanted him to say: ‘I am sorry, Pen.’ He didn’t, he just said: ‘For God’s sake you are pathetic.’” That was the moment when she “lost it”, she told jurors. She said: “I just thought: I cannot do this. It is not fair and I lost control.”     Penelope Jackson seen after her arrest for attempted murder of her husband. Photograph: Police handout    After the incident, she calmly told the police she was “compos mentis” and was prepared to confess. She said he goaded her that she had not even “been able to do [the stabbing] right”, prompting her to stab him two more times while he was on the phone to 999, she claimed. She later refused instructions from a paramedic to help him. The prosecution contended that the shocking recordings from the emergency calls, which were played to the jury, were evidence of a murder committed in cold blood. But the defence argued that the killing was the result of decades of shame, abuse and secrecy that finally boiled over. Jackson has said the violence dated back to 1998, shortly after David Jackson’s son from his first marriage killed himself. Potterton described her father as a “broken man” in its wake, and observed three violent incidents, one in which he held a knife to Jackson’s throat. Jackson said in the following years her husband controlled which TV shows she watched and repeatedly abused her, including strangling, verbal aggression and forced sex. She felt ashamed and afraid of leaving him, but also grateful to her husband for being a “good father” to Potterton. In December the couple’s toxic relationship is said to have worsened when a row over a remote control resulted in her calling the police after she locked her husband in the conservatory, where he was brandishing a poker. Her computer’s search history showed she researched domestic violence refuges later that evening. Yet Jackson’s daughter’s testimony described a largely “idyllic” family life of domestic comforts, and a loving relationship between two parents. In her testimony, Jackson reflected on how she had struggled with being stuck shielding at home with her husband during lockdowns, and had visited a doctor to discuss her drinking. She said: “I was there all the time, there was no escape.” Tom Potterton, Isabelle’s husband, described David Jackson as “a proud and traditional man who didn’t like to show his emotions”. Jane Calverley, David Jackson’s daughter from his first marriage, said she thought her father always seemed “on edge” with his wife, who she said “baited” him and enjoyed making people feel uncomfortable. During the hearing, Wade described Jackson as a vulnerable woman ravaged by deep shame about her fostered upbringing and failed marriages. She had fled her physically abusive first marriage, and her third husband killed himself after learning of her affair with David Jackson. As a result, Wade said, Jackson was determined to live what was, at least on the surface, a “perfect life”. She said this lasted until Jackson was deprived of any “release from the atmosphere of the house”. Worn down by years of control, criticism and occasional physical violence, that night “everything imploded”, the court was told. Ultimately, although Jackson appeared lucid in her admissions that were recorded on the night, Wade argued: “These are the words and actions of a woman who is out of control, she is totally detached from the reality of what has happened.” Prof Jane Monckton Smith, a criminologist specialising in abusive relationships, told the Guardian there was clear evidence of coercive control in Jackson’s case but that in the past there had been problems with the concept – a complex umbrella term encompassing multiple types of abuse – being poorly communicated to jurors. “Victims can get to the stage where they think ‘I’ve got to leave, the only way is to kill this person’ or sometimes they think ‘I’m actually so traumatised by all this now that I’ve rather take the consequences of killing this person than carry on as I am’,” she said. “There is definitely a concern among professionals that sentencing for women who kill abusive partners seems to be more harsh than for men who kill partners who are trying to leave them.”",row husband serving bubble squeak birthday meal lobster champagne penelope jackson identified moment broke took knife kitchen stabbed david jackson multiple time

There, they located the remains buried in the garden. The body is expected to be taken to Leicester, where it will be forensically examined by a Home Office pathologist.

Ian Stewart, 61, killed Diane Stewart in 2010 and told family, friends and medical professionals that she had died after having an epileptic seizure, Huntingdon crown court heard, but on Wednesday a jury ruled that he was guilty of her murder. 
It was only after he was arrested on suspicion of the murder of Helen Bailey in 2016 that an investigation into Diane Stewart’s death was launched, and tests on her brain tissue – which she had donated to medical science – revealed that she may have suffered a lack of oxygen to her brain for up to an hour before her death. 
The judge, Mr Justice Simon Bryan, said Stewart would serve a whole-life order without any possibility of parole or conditional release. “It no doubt never crossed your mind that the donation of Diane’s brain for teaching and research would lead to your ultimate downfall, as it was to do,” he said. 
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
The judge added that there were “striking similarities” between the two murders, and that both had involved Stewart telling “a series of calculated and callous lies” and “acting out a charade”. 
A whole-life order was the only “just punishment for your callous and chilling murder of two separate woman who had the misfortune to be in an intimate relationship with you”, he added. 
The couple’s children, Jamie and Oliver Stewart, paid tribute to their mother in a joint statement released through police.

“Our mum was amazing,” the said. “All the people we have spoken to and things we have heard since her death have only enhanced this feeling.” The pair said they had a “wonderful, caring upbringing”, adding that the past six years had been “really upsetting”. 
“We now look forward to recalling the many happy moments we had growing up as a family,” they said. 
During the three-week trial, a jury heard that Diane’s death in 2010 was recorded as sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP), after Stewart said he had found his wife collapsed at their home in Bassingbourn, Cambridgeshire, in 2010. 
In 2017, Stewart was found guilty of killing Bailey, the author of the Electra Brown series, a year earlier. He drugged Bailey with his sleeping medication before hiding her body, along with that of her pet dachshund, Boris, in a 100-year-old cesspit concealed beneath the garage of their £1.3m property in Royston, Hertfordshire. 
After the guilty verdict in 2017, police reopened the case, and while the original postmortem had not treated Diane Stewart’s death as suspicious, later examination of brain tissue showed signs that “breathing had been restricted” for between 35 minutes and an hour before her death.

A consultant neurologist estimated the risk of the 47-year-old having had a fatal epileptic seizure to be about one in 100,000; a Home Office pathologist said he would have expected to see injuries on the outside of a body of someone who had fallen on concrete during a fit, but no such injuries were found on the body. 
The court heard Stewart had delayed several times before ringing 999 on 25 June 2010, and said he had performed CPR before attempting to get help from a doctor and a nurse who lived opposite. He said he had tried CPR again, before finally ringing the emergency services. 
A paramedic who attended the scene said Stewart “appeared dissociative and was simply answering questions calmly”, and there were no signs of the bodily trauma that normally accompanied the administering of effective CPR. 
At his wife’s funeral, Stewart “seemed totally unbothered and seemed quite aloof”, said her friend Alexandra Bailey, while her sister Wendy Bellamy-Lee said he was “very calm”. 
Det Supt Jerome Kent, who led the investigations into both women, called Stewart a “master manipulator”. 
“He had the ability to convince agencies of his innocence and kept the truth of what happened from family and friends, keeping those lies going over months and years as well as through the court process,” he said. 
He added: “There is no typical victim of domestic abuse. The fact is, it can happen to anyone” 
After Diane’s death, Stewart inherited £96,000, which he said was for their sons’ future. He bought a red two-seater MG, but insisted the purchase was in her memory. 
The prosecution QC, Stuart Trimmer – the same barrister who prosecuted Stewart’s first trial – suggested Stewart did not do the probate paperwork for a further £50,000 he could have claimed because by the end of the year of her death he had already met Helen Bailey in an online bereavement group. 
Diane Stewart’s siblings, sister Wendy Bellamy-Lee and brother Christopher Lem, called her “a very special, caring and capable person” who would “always be greatly loved and hugely missed by her family and all who knew her”.",man found guilty killing fiancee dumping body cesspit die prison sentenced wholelife order murdering first wife six year earlier ian stewart killed diane stewart told family friend medical professional died epileptic seizure huntingdon crown court heard wednesday jury ruled guilty murder arrested suspicion murder helen bailey investigation diane stewart ’ death launched test brain tissue – donated medical science – revealed may suffered lack oxygen brain hour death judge mr justice simon bryan said stewart would serve wholelife order without possibility parole conditional release “ doubt never crossed mind donation diane ’ brain teaching research would lead ultimate downfall ” said judge added “ striking similarity ” two murder involved stewart telling “ series calculated callous lie ” “ acting charade ” wholelife order “ punishment callous chilling murder two separate woman misfortune intimate relationship ” added couple ’ child jamie oliver stewart paid tribute mother joint statement released police related ian stewart narcissistic serial killer fooled everyone “ mum amazing ” said “ people spoken thing heard since death enhanced feeling ” pair said “ wonderful caring upbringing ” adding past six year “ really upsetting ” “ look forward recalling many happy moment growing family ” said threeweek trial jury heard diane ’ death recorded sudden unexplained death epilepsy sudep stewart said found wife collapsed home bassingbourn cambridgeshire stewart found guilty killing bailey author electra brown series year earlier drugged bailey sleeping medication hiding body along pet dachshund boris yearold cesspit concealed beneath garage £m property royston hertfordshire guilty verdict police reopened case original postmortem treated diane stewart ’ death suspicious later examination brain tissue showed sign “ breathing restricted ” minute hour death diane stewart photograph family handoutpa consultant neurologist estimated risk yearold fatal epileptic seizure one home office pathologist said would expected see injury outside body someone fallen concrete fit injury found body court heard stewart delayed several time ringing june said performed cpr attempting get help doctor nurse lived opposite said tried cpr finally ringing emergency service paramedic attended scene said stewart “ appeared dissociative simply answering question calmly ” sign bodily trauma normally accompanied administering effective cpr wife ’ funeral stewart “ seemed totally unbothered seemed quite aloof ” said friend alexandra bailey sister wendy bellamylee said “ calm ” det supt jerome kent led investigation woman called stewart “ master manipulator ” “ ability convince agency innocence kept truth happened family friend keeping lie going month year well court process ” said added “ typical victim domestic abuse fact happen anyone ” diane ’ death stewart inherited £ said son ’ future bought red twoseater mg insisted purchase memory prosecution qc stuart trimmer – barrister prosecuted stewart ’ first trial – suggested stewart probate paperwork £ could claimed end year death already met helen bailey online bereavement group diane stewart ’ sibling sister wendy bellamylee brother christopher lem called “ special caring capable person ” would “ always greatly loved hugely missed family knew ”,,"None, Torino, Piemonte, Italia","(44.933143, 7.540121, 0.0)",44.933143,7.540121,0.0

The bodies of John Paul Bennett, 13, Lacey Bennett, 11, their mother Terri Harris, 35, and Lacey’s friend Connie Gent, 11, were discovered at a property in Killamarsh on Sunday morning. Damien Bendall appeared at Derby crown court via video-link from HMP Wakefield on Friday morning accused of the four murders. Appearing before the judge, Nirmal Shant QC, the honorary recorder of Derby, Bendall spoke only to say “yeah, correct” when confirming his name to the court clerk. Wearing a grey sweatshirt, Bendall listened as a date was set for a trial expected to take place between 1 March and 27 May. Duncan Penny QC, prosecuting, told the judge extra time was needed before the next hearing because it was a “very complex scene” and there were “ongoing forensic inquiries of a very significant nature taking place”. Shant remanded Bendall in custody to appear at a pre-trial hearing on 26 November at Nottingham crown court. He is expected to attend via video-link from prison. The charges against Bendall allege that he murdered all four victims on a day between Friday 17 September and Monday 20 September. Derbyshire constabulary said the bodies of the four victims were found after police responded to a call about concerns for the safety of a man at the property at 7.26am on Sunday.
