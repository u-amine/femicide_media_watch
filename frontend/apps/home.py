    # There is one key barrier to understanding the global impact of femicide: there is no global definition of femicide.
    # That means that individual countries and institutions are only collecting data that fits within these, often very narrow, definitions.
    # For example, in the UK trans women are routinely omitted from datasets, and in Chile, until a few years ago, women murdered by people other than their partner,
    # or ex-partner, were not included at all. This results in data that is inaccessible, miscategorised and too varied in indicators.

    # \n
    # Subsequently, womenâ€™s organisations and  social justice groups, who are often underfunded and under-resourced,
    # have picked up the slack by collecting detailed femicide records; the work by these organisations will be supported
    # by this project that aims to provide a platform for their data, and have a positive effect on the reporting of femicide and gender violence.
